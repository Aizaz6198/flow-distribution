## Introduction

This Node.js application is for designing and implementing a flow distribution algorithm in Node.js for connecting users with astrologers. The goal is to ensure that each astrologer gets an equal proportion of chances to connect with users, while also providing the flexibility to adjust flow for top astrologers.

## Features

1. Design a flow distribution algorithm that allocates users to astrologers in a fair and balanced manner.
2. Implement a mechanism to toggle the flow for top astrologers, allowing them to receive more or fewer connections as desired.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Aizaz6198/flow-distribution.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd placement-cell

3.  Install dependencies:  
    npm install

    
## Usage
Start the server:
    npm start
    
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Configuration

Create a .env file in the root of your project with the following content:

-MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://yourusername:yourpassword@cluster0.iaiuzrt.mongodb.net/your-database.

-SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key.

-PORT=3000.

Adjust the MongoDB URI as needed.
